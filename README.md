# Species-specific-recogniser

The attached code and data will allow you to train a random forest to detect great green macaws. 

The code will import a training dataset that was created using template matching (which is not included - see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/monitoR/vignettes/monitoR_QuickStart.pdf). 

Also attached is the R project and associated data which, when loaded, will allow you to run all the code from start to finish. As it is training a random forest and depending on your computer spec this could take days. If you do not want to train the random forest, but simply want to see the outputs I have included these as well.
